# Introduction

The invention of Git was by all means one the best things that happened to the software industry in the past ten years. It's not that we haven't had version control before. In fact, most of us were happily using SVN or other version control systems before we made the switch. We didn't know how much better things could get. 

On the other hand, I've never met anyone who wanted to go back to SVN after he groked the full power of Git. Git has features that you'll learn to love after you employed them in your daily workflow but didn't even know they exist before.

This book is about Git's most powerful feature: Rebasing. If you now think: *"I know what rebasing is. Why write an entire book on it?"*, read on. You'll be suprised how much there is about rebasing that you probably don't know.

## Who This Book is For?

This book is intended as a guide for people already familiar with Git. While a deep understanding of Git isn't necessary to use this book, you would leave out many more basic features of Git if this is your first Git book. If you don't feel familiar with the basics of Git we recommend to read the free [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) before you read on.
